# Metagenomics workshop
### Applied meta-omics summer school
### Day 3

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to metagenomics** with a focus on natural product research.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

         <br>From the UMAP visualization of our data  we can see that the cells are positioned into groups. Our next task is to isolate clusters of cells that are most similar to one another based on gene expression. <br><br>In this lesson you will:<br>
             - Learn the theory behind clustering and how it is performed in Seurat<br>
             - Cluster cells and visualize them on the UMAP<br>
